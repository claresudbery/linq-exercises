Two hours is not long if you want to cover the following:
	Query syntax vs fluent syntax (including "let" keyword)
	Combining intersect with aggregate to solve the Combined example
	Group by
	Lazy evaluation

A worked example of both fluent and query method syntax: http://jesseliberty.com/2011/01/27/linq-and-fluent-programming/
The repo / exercises we were working with today: https://github.com/walkhard/linq-exercises
101 Linq Samples (but they all use query syntax): https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/101-LINQ-Samples-3fb9811b/viewsamplepack
A query syntax example using the "let" keyword to create variables in the middle of the statement: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383976.aspx

Feedback after session: Working in pairs is good	
Split people into pairs. Rotate pairs frequently. Pay attention to timings! 

!! I ended up spending ages experimenting with the solution to one problem in particular - the result is in CombinedOperationExperiment.cs in the repo: https://github.com/claresudbery/linq-exercises
(there is also a copy in ConsoleCatchAll, which is where I originally wrote it)
